# 🐨 Me

I am currently a second-year Master student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervise of [Prof. Fan Cheng](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chengfan/index.html), major in computer science. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in IEEE honor class at SJTU, major in computer science. I used to be a research intern at [ SJTU interpretable ML lab](https://sjtu-xai-lab.github.io/), guided by [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com) during my undergraduate study.

In 2021.10~2022, I worked as a research intern in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) [DKI group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) guided by [Haoyu Dong](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hadong/). I worked on some interesting research topics related to semi-structured tabular data, such as table pre-training, table question answering. 

Currently, I work as a research assistant in [XLang Lab](https://xlang.ai) @[HKUNLP](https://hkunlp.github.io/) advised by Prof. Tao Yu.
I also have the fortune to work with [Qian Liu](https://siviltaram.github.io/) at [Sea AI Lab](https://sail.sea.com/), who is an excellent collaborator!🤗
