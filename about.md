## 🐨 Me

Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Jingcai Guo](https://jingcaiguo.github.io/). I am also a member of the vibrant [Lumen Group](https://lumen-lab-polyu.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. degree, under the supervision of [Prof. Bo Chen](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/), and my B.Eng. degree, all from Xidian University in 2023 and 2020 respectively.

My research interest includes but not limited to Zero-shot Learning, Few-shot Learning and Optimal Transport.
